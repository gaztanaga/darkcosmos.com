title: "What if the Big Bang Wasn’t the Beginning?"

The Big Bang is often described as the explosive birth of the Universe — a singular moment when space, time, and matter sprang into existence. But what if this was not the beginning at all? What if our Universe emerged from something else — something both more familiar and more radical? In a new paper just published in Physical Review D, my colleagues and I propose a striking alternative: that the Big Bang was not the start of everything, but rather the outcome of a gravitational collapse that formed a very massive black hole — followed by a bounce inside. This idea — which we call the Black Hole Universe — offers a radically different view of cosmic origins, yet it is grounded entirely in known physics and observations.
