title: "What if the Big Bang Wasn’t the Beginning?"

The Big Bang is often described as the explosive birth of the Universe — a singular moment when space, time, and matter sprang into existence. But what if this was not the beginning at all? What if our Universe emerged from something else — something both more familiar and more radical? In a new paper just published in Physical Review D, my colleagues and I propose a striking alternative: that the Big Bang was not the start of everything, but rather the outcome of a gravitational collapse that formed a very massive black hole — followed by a bounce inside. This idea — which we call the Black Hole Universe — offers a radically different view of cosmic origins, yet it is grounded entirely in known physics and observations.

**The Standard model**

Today’s standard cosmological model, based on the Big Bang and cosmic inflation, has been remarkably successful in explaining the structure and evolution of the Universe. But it comes at a price: it leaves some of the most fundamental questions unanswered. For one, the Big Bang model begins with a singularity — a point of infinite density and zero volume where the laws of physics break down. This is not just a technical glitch; it’s a deep theoretical problem that suggests we don’t really understand the beginning at all. To explain the Universe’s large-scale structure, physicists introduced a brief phase of rapid expansion called inflation, powered by an unknown field with strange properties. Later, to explain the accelerating expansion observed today, they added another “mysterious” component: dark energy. In short, the standard model of cosmology works well — but only by introducing new ingredients we have never observed directly. Meanwhile, the most basic questions remain open: Where did everything come from? Why did it begin this way? And why is the Universe so flat, smooth, and large?

**The non-singular Black Hole Universe**

Our new model tackles these questions from a different angle — by looking inward instead of outward. Instead of starting with an expanding Universe and asking how it began, we consider what happens when an overdensity of matter collapses under gravity. This is a familiar process: stars collapse into black holes, which are among the most well-understood objects in general relativity. But what happens inside a black hole, beyond the event horizon, remains a mystery. In 1965, Roger Penrose proved that under very general conditions, gravitational collapse must lead to a singularity. This result, extended by Stephen Hawking and others, underpins the idea that singularities — like the one at the Big Bang — are unavoidable. The idea helped win Penrose a share of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics and inspired the global bestseller A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes. But there’s a caveat. These “singularity theorems” rely on classical physics. If we include quantum effects, as we must at extreme densities, the story may change.

**A New Solution — Without New Physics or singularities**

In our new paper, we show that gravitational collapse does not have to end in a singularity. We find an exact analytical solution, a mathematical result with no approximations: where as we approach the potential singularity, the size of the universe changes as the hyperbolic function of cosmic time. This simple hyperbolic solution describes how a collapsing cloud of matter can reach a high-density state and then bounce, rebounding outward into a new expanding phase. Crucially, this bounce occurs entirely within the framework of general relativity, combined with the basic principles of quantum mechanics — no exotic fields, extra dimensions, or speculative physics required. What emerges on the other side of the bounce is a Universe remarkably like our own. Even more surprisingly, the rebound naturally produces a phase of accelerated expansion — inflation — driven not by a hypothetical field but by the physics of the bounce itself.

**Escaping the Singularity**

How is this possible, if Penrose’s theorems rule out such outcomes? Gravity pushes matter together, but the quantum exclusion principle prevents particles from being squeezed indefinitely. As a result, the collapse halts and reverses. This isn’t just a numerical simulation or a speculative sketch. We now have a fully worked-out solution that shows the bounce is not only possible — it’s inevitable under the right conditions.

**Predictions and Observational Tests**

One of the strengths of this model is that it makes testable predictions. It predicts a small but non-zero amount of positive spatial curvature — meaning the Universe is not exactly flat, but slightly curved, like the surface of the Earth. This is simply a relic of the initial overdensity that triggered the collapse. It also predicts a small cosmological constant (Λ), which drives the current acceleration of cosmic expansion. The value of Λ has already been measured with great precision, and our model explains why this value is so enormously small but not zero: its inverse is given by the total mass of our Universe — which, in this framework, is also the mass of the black hole whose event horizon defines the Λ boundary of our cosmos. But spatial curvature remains an open question — and one that upcoming cosmological surveys, such as the ongoing Euclid ESA mission, may soon be able to resolve. If future observations confirm a small positive curvature, it would be a strong hint that our Universe did indeed emerge from such a bounce.

**New Perspectives**

This model does more than fix technical problems with standard cosmology. It could also shed new light on other deep mysteries in our understanding of the early Universe — such as the origin of supermassive black holes, the nature of dark matter, or the hierarchical formation and evolution of galaxies. These questions will be explored by future space missions like ARRAKIHS, which will study faint low surface brightness structures — diffuse features such as stellar halos, tidal streams, and satellite galaxies that are difficult to detect with traditional telescopes from Earth. All of these phenomena might be linked to relic compact objects — such as neutron stars or black holes — that formed during the collapsing phase and survived the bounce.

Inside the Black Hole, the collapse continuous until it reaches a saturation density given by the quantum exclusion principle. This initiates a bounce and exponential expansion which connects with the Big Bang model and cosmic inflation. The universe is now trapped inside its event horizon which produces late time cosmic acceleration (a cosmological constant or dark energy). The bottom panel shows the radius (in log scale) as a function of time (the scale facgtor). *

**The Black Hole Universe** also offers a new perspective on our place in the cosmos. In this framework, our entire observable Universe lies inside the interior of a black hole formed in some larger “parent” universe. We are not special — no more than Earth was in the geocentric worldview that placed Galileo under house arrest. We are not witnessing the birth of everything from nothing, but rather the continuation of a cosmic cycle — one shaped by gravity, quantum mechanics, and the deep interconnections between them.
