<p>Hello, my name is Enrique Gaztanaga. I'm <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/news/portsmouth-professor-awarded-freedom-of-the-city-of-london"style="color: #007bff;">
  Professor at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (University of Portsmouth, UK)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ice.csic.es/?view=article&id=576&catid=8"style="color: #007bff;"> Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC, IEEC, Barcelona)</a>. I teach undergraduate and post graduate Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology and have co-led hundreds of peer-reviewed publications in Cosmology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I work both on theoretical and observational topics and have helped build and analyze several international Cosmic Experiments (SDSS, 2dFGRS, Planck, DES, PAUS, DESI, Euclid, LSST, ARRAKIHS).</p>

<p>You can find below some posts about the Black Hole Universe, a concept that can help us late time undestand cosmic acceleration, early time cosmic inflation and some other anomalies in the standard model of Cosmology. <br>
You can <a href="/papers" style="color: #007bff;">link to more technical papers here</a> (and reference therein).</p>
