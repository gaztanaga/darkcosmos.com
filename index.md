  <p>Welcome!</p>

  <p>Hello, my name is Enrique Gaztanaga. I'm Professor at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (UoP, UK) and the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC, IEEC). I teach Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology and have co-led hundreds of peer-reviewed publications in Cosmology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I work both on theoretical and observational topics and have helped build and analyze several international Cosmic Experiments. I am writing this blog to bring front-line research to interested readers.</p>
