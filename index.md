Welcome! 

Hello, my name is Enrique Gaztanaga. I'm Professor at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (UoP, UK) and the Institute of  Space Sciences (CSIC, IEEC). I teach  Physics, Astrophysics and  Cosmology and have co-led hundreds of peer reviewed publications in Cosmology, Physic and Astrophysics.  I work both on theoretical and observational topics and  have helped build and analyze several international Cosmic Experiments.  I am writing this blog to bring front line research to interested readers.
