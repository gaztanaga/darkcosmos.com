<p>Hello, my name is Enrique Gaztanaga. I'm Professor at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (University of Portsmouth, UK) and the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC, IEEC, Barcelona). I teach undergraduate and post graduate Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology and have co-led hundreds of peer-reviewed publications in Cosmology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I work both on theoretical and observational topics and have helped build and analyze several international Cosmic Experiments.
