  Hello — my name is Enrique Gaztanaga. I'm a 
  <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/news-events-and-blogs/news/portsmouth-professor-awarded-freedom-of-the-city-of-london" style="color: #007bff;">
    Professor at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (University of Portsmouth, UK)</a> and also affiliated with the 
  <a href="https://www.ice.csic.es/?view=article&id=576&catid=8" style="color: #007bff;">Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC, IEEC, Barcelona)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I teach undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology, and have co-authored hundreds of peer-reviewed publications. My research spans both theoretical and observational fronts, and I have contributed to the design and analysis of several major international cosmology projects — including SDSS, 2dFGRS, Planck, DES, PAUS, DESI, Euclid, LSST, and ARRAKIHS.

  This blog shares ideas and results around the <strong>Black Hole Universe</strong> — a new framework that may shed light on the
